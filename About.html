				<h2> Introduction</h2>
				<p>Information Technology (IT) is widely recognized as one of the fastest-growing sectors in today's economy. The rapid advancement of technology and increasing reliance on digital solutions has fueled the growth and demand for IT professionals. According to a report by Gartner, the global IT spending is projected to reach $4.5 trillion in 2021, with an annual growth rate of 8%. This growth is driven by various factors, including the increasing adoption of cloud computing, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the expansion of digital transformation across industries.</p>
				<p>Information Technology (IT) has revolutionized the healthcare industry, improving patient care, enhancing efficiency, and enabling better decision-making. Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems have streamlined the storage and access of patient information, leading to improved coordination of care among healthcare providers. According to a study by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, the adoption of EHR systems has increased significantly, with 96% of non-federal acute care hospitals utilizing certified EHR technology.</p>

				<h2>The problem</h2>
                <p>The Ugandan population is currently estimated at forty-six million people as of 2020, growing at a rate of 3.32% annually.
                     With increasing population, there comes a large demand for health care. This has been seen by increased time to service of patients at hospitals i.e. long lines, waiting long hours for results, making consultations etc. The need to improve the health service provision in the country inspired our interest in the sector.</p>
