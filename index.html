													1)<b>Reminders:</b>. This would be through mapping of patients and 
														their medical information, (given that the medicine the patients are given is stored in the system) we can use that information to help patients follow up 
														with their medications. For example, if you are supposed to take your medication 3X a day i.e morning, evening and night......the mobile application would 
														be able to send you automatic reminders for all the prescribed drugs. <br/> 
													2)  -This will help to provide recommendations to patients. It will include modules like chatbot 
													which provides recommendations based on the communicated symptoms and signs through the chat and incase the signs and symptoms communicated require a lot of medical 
													attention the system advises you to meet a doctor or do an online consultation through the telemedicine subsystem and a home module which provides the common daily 
													healthy tips to individuals for example are you taking water, are you working out etc.<br/>
												
													3) <b>Chat bots/ Health Assistant</b>. We aimed at providing AI driven medical recommendations based on patient history and communication of symptoms, health tips and 
														medical management)<br/>
													Why chatbots and health assistants?<br/>
													We looked at a vision where one can ably consult an AI doctor for recommendation on how to go about certain illnesses. This AI doctor could provide a series 
														of steps on how to go about a particular medical situation.<br/>
												
													4) <b>Data Explorer</b> <p> The data explorer submodule leverages on the patient data fetched by the API and using data analysis, recommendations are made as to which area is mostly affected by a particular disease and a recommended course of action is taken by doctors <br/>
